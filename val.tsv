biden/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_46_1_long.wav|my plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. the previous administration not only ballooned the deficit with those tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations.

biden/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_53_2_long.wav|and because this virus mutates and spreads we have to stay on guard. and here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely in my view. first, stay protected with vaccines and treatments.
biden/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_53_3_long.wav|if you're vacinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. we will never give up on vaccinating more americans. now i know parents with kids under five eager to see their vaccines authorized for the children.

biden/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_54_3_long.wav|if necessary will be able to develop new vaccines in a hundred days instead of maybe months or years. and if congress presides the funds we need we'll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, pills ready if needed.
biden/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_57_1_long.wav|most americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom and moved forward safely. we achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests and masks.
biden/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_58_long.wav|the vast majority of americans have used these tools and may want again, we may need them again, so i expect congress and i hope he'll pass that quickly. fourth, we'll continue vaccinating the world.
biden/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_59_1_long.wav|you know, we've lost so much in covid nineteen. time with one another. worst of all much loss of life. let's use this moment to reset.

biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_10_long_2.wav|even though that’s what ninety three united states senators, his own attorney general, his own vice president, governors and state officials in every battleground state
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_10_short.wav|have all said.

biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_3_long.wav|and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in iraq. they’ve repeatedly asked since that day. how dare anyone, anyone, diminish, belittle or deny.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_3_short.wav|the hell they were put through.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_3_short_2.wav|we saw it with our own eyes.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_4_long.wav|rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the speaker of the house, literally erecting gallows to hang the vice president of the united states of america. what do we not see?
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_4_short.wav|we didn’t see a former president.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_4_short_2.wav|who had just rallied.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_4_short_3.wav|the mob to attack.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_5_long.wav|sitting in the privat, dining room off the oval office in the white house, watching it all on television, and doing nothing, for hours, as police were assaulted.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_5_long_2.wav|lives at risk, and the nation’s capital under siege. this wasn’t a group of tourists.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_5_short.wav|armed insurrection.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_6_long.wav|they weren’t looking to uphold the will of the people. they were looking to deny the will of the people. they were looking to uphold, they weren’t looking to uphold a free and fair election they were looking to overturn one. they weren’t looking to save.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_7_long.wav|they were looking to subvert the constitution. this isn’t about being bogged down in the past. this is about making sure the past isn’t buried.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_7_long_2.wav|that’s the only way forward. that’s what great nations do. they don’t bury the truth, they face up to it.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_8_long.wav|sounds like hyperbole but that’s the truth they face up to it! we are a great nation. my fellow Americans, in life there’s truth and, tragically there are lies.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_8_long_2.wav|lies conceived and spread, for profit, and power. we must be absolutely clear about what is true, and what is a lie.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_8_short.wav|here is the truth.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_9_long.wav|the former president of the united states of america, has created and spread a web of lies, about the twenty twenty election.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_2_9_long_2.wav|he’s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests, as more important than his country’s interests and america’s interests.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_10_long.wav|the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win, is to suppress your vote, and subvert our elections.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_10_long_2.wav|wrong. it’s undemocratic. and frankly, it’s unamerican. the second big lie, being told by the former president and his supporters.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_11_long.wav|is that the results of the election of twenty twenty can’t be trusted. the truth is that, no election! no election in american history has been more closely scrutinized.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_11_long_2.wav|or more carefully counted. every legal challenge questioning the results, in every court in this country.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_12_long.wav|that could have been made, was made and was rejected. often rejected by republican appointed judges
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_12_long_2.wav|including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the united states supreme court. recounts were undertaken in state after state.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_13_long.wav|georgia, georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand. phony partisan audits were undertaken.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_13_long_2.wav|long after the election in several states. none, changed the results. and in some of them the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_1_long.wav|trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. they seem no longer to want to be the party.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_1_long_2.wav|the party of lincoln, eisenhower, reagan, the bushes. but whatever my other disagreements are with republicans who support the rule of law.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_2_long.wav|and not the rule of a single man, i will always seek to work together with them, to find shared solutions where possible. because if we have a shared belief in democracy.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_2_long_2.wav|then anything is possible, anything. and so at this moment, we must decide, what kind of nation are we going to be.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_3_long.wav|Are we gonna be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? are we gonna be a nation, where we allow partisan election officials to overturn.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_3_long_2.wav|the legally expressed will of the people? are we gonna be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth, but in the shadow, of lies.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_4_long.wav|we cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. the way forward, is to recognize the truth, and to live by it.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_4_long_2.wav|the big lie being told by the former president and many republicans, who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place, on election day.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_5_long.wav|november three third, two thousand and twenty. Think about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought, when you voted that day.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_5_long_2.wav|taking part in an insurrection is that what you thought you were doing? or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen, and voting.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_7_long.wav|can you think of a more twisted way, to look at this country to look at america? i cannot. here’s the truth. the election of twenty twenty.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_7_long_2.wav|was the greatest, demonstration of democracy in the history of this country. more of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of american history.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_8_long.wav|over hundred and fifty million americans went to the polls and voted that day, in a pandemic some at grease grea grea great risk to their lives.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_8_long_2.wav|they should be applauded, not attacked. right now, in state after state, new laws are being written. not to protect the vote, but to deny it.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_9_long.wav|not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it. not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost. instead of looking at the election results from twenty twenty and saying.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_9_short.wav|they need new ideas.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_9_short_2.wav|or better ideas.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_3_9_short_3.wav|to win more votes.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_10_long.wav|but their plot was foiled. congressmen democrats and republicans stayed. senators representatives staff, they finished their work the constitution demanded. they honored their oath
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_10_short.wav|defend the constitution.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_10_short_2.wav|against all.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_10_short_3.wav|enemies.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_10_short_4.wav|foreign and.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_10_short_5.wav|domestic.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_1_long.wav|he built his lie over months. it wasn’t based on any facts. he was just looking for an excuse, a pretext, to cover for the truth. he’s not just a former president. he’s a defeated.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_1_long_2.wav|former president, defeated by a margin of over seven million of your votes, in a full and free and fair election.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_2_long.wav|there is simply zero proof! the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue, where evidence had to be produced, and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_2_short.wav|president failed to make his case.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_2_short_2.wav|оust think about this.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_3_long.wav|the former president and his supporters, have never been able to explain, how they accept as accurate, the other election results that took place.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_3_long_2.wav|on november third. the elections for governor, united states senate, the house of representatives, elections, in which they closed the gap, in the house.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_4_long.wav|they challenge none of that. the president’s name was first, then we went down the line, governors senators house of representatives. somehow those results were accurate on the same ballot.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_4_long_2.wav|presidential race was flawed? and on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_5_long.wav|the only difference. the former president didn’t lose those races. he just lost the one that was his own. finally, the third big lie being told by a former president and his supporters.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_5_short.wav|mob who sough.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_5_short_2.wav|impose their will.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_5_short_3.wav|violence.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_5_short_4.wav|are the nation’s true patriots.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_6_long.wav|that what you thought, when you looked at the mob ransacking the capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_6_long_2.wav|rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? patriots? not in my view.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_7_long.wav|to me the true patriots were the more than hundred fifty americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this capitol.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_7_short.wav|you can’t love your country.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_7_short_2.wav|only when you win.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_8_long.wav|you can’t obey the law only when it’s convenient. you can’t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies. those who stormed this capitol.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_8_long_2.wav|those who instigated and incited, and those who called on them to do so, held a dagger at the throat of america, at american democracy.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_9_long.wav|they didn’t come here out of patriotism or principle. they came here in rage, not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_4_9_long_2.wav|those who incited the mob, the real plotters, who were desperate to deny the certification of the election, and defy the will of the voters.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_5_1_long.wav|now it’s up to all of us, to we the people, to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_5_1_long_2.wav|keep the promise of america alive. that promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength, over the sanctity of democracy.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_5_2_middle.wav|fear over hope, personal gain over public good.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_5_2_middle_2.wav|make no mistake about it. we’re living at an inflection point in history.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_5_2_middle_3.wav|both at home and abroad, we’re engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_6_1_middle.wav|between the people’s right of self determination, and self, the self seeking autocrat.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_6_1_middle_2.wav|from China, to Russia and beyond, they’re betting that democracy’s days are numbered.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_6_1_middle_3.wav|actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division, to succeed in today’s rapidly changing complicated world.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_6_2_middle.wav|and they’re betting, they’re betting america will become more like them.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_6_2_middle_2.wav|and less like us. they’re betting that america is a place.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_6_2_middle_3.wav|for the autocrat the dictator the strongman. i do not believe that.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_6_2_middle_4.wav|that is not who we have ever been! and that is not who we should ever, ever be.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_1_middle.wav|our founding fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_1_middle_2.wav|literally changed the world. here in america.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_1_middle_3.wav|the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_1_short.wav|never at the tip of a.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_1_short_2.wav|spear or the barrel of a gun.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_2_middle.wav|and they committed, to paper an idea that couldn’t live up to they couldn’t live up to but an idea.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_2_middle_2.wav|that couldn’t be constrained. yes, in america all people.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_2_middle_3.wav|are created equal. we reject the view, that if that if you succeed.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_2_middle_4.wav|i fail. if you get ahead, i fall behind.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_3_middle.wav|if i hold you down, i somehow lift myself up.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_3_middle_2.wav|the former president, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this capitol, could not be further away.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_3_middle_3.wav|from the core american values. they want to rule.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_3_short.wav|or they will ruin.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_4_middle.wav|ruin what our country fought for at lexington and concord, at gettysburg at omaha beach.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_4_middle_2.wav|seneca falls, selma alabama. what? and what we were fighting for.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_4_middle_3.wav|the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_4_short.wav|and with rights come responsibilities.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_5_middle.wav|with rights come responsibilities. the responsibility to see each other as neighbors.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_5_middle_2.wav|maybe we disagree with that neighbor but they’re not an adversary. еhe responsibility to accept defeat.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_5_middle_3.wav|then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_7_5_middle_4.wav|the responsibility to see that america is an idea, an idea that requires, vigilant stewardship.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_1_middle.wav|as we stand here today, one year since january sixth twenty twenty one.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_1_middle_2.wav|the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_1_middle_3.wav|so we have to be firm, resolute and unyielding in our defense.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_1_short.wav|right to vote.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_1_short_2.wav|and to have that vote counted.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_2_middle.wav|some have already made the ultimate sacrifice, in this sacred effort.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_2_middle_2.wav|jill and i, have mourned police officers in this capitol rotunda not once but twice, in the wake of january sixth.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_2_middle_3.wav|once to honor officer brian sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack and, a second time to honor.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_2_short.wav|officer billy evans.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_3_middle.wav|who lost his life defending this capitol as well. we think about the others who lost their lives and were injured, and everyone living with the trauma of that day.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_3_middle_2.wav|those defending this capitol, to members of congress in both parties.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_3_middle_3.wav|and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers custodial workers.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_8_3_short.wav|and their families.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_9_1_middle.wav|don’t kid yourself. the pain and scars from that day run deep.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_9_1_middle_2.wav|i said it many times, and it’s no more true or real.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_9_1_short.wav|we think about the events.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_9_1_short_2.wav|of january sixth.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_9_2_middle.wav|we are in a battle for the soul of America.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_9_2_middle_2.wav|a battle, that by the grace of god, and the goodness and gracious.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_9_2_middle_3.wav|and greatness of this nation, we will win. believe me, i know how difficult democracy is.
biden/FGQZokwAufM_9_2_short.wav|and i’m crystal clear.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_1_1_middle.wav|mcconnell, vice president pence, my distinguished guests and my fellow americans.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_1_1_middle_2.wav|this, is America’s day. this is democracy’s day. a day of history and hope.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_1_1_middle_3.wav|of renewal and resolve, through a crucible, for the ages America has been tested anew.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_1_1_short.wav|and America has risen.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_1_1_short_2.wav|to the challenge.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_1_2_middle.wav|today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_1_2_middle_2.wav|the cause of democracy. the people, the will of the people.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_1_2_middle_3.wav|has been heard, and the will of the people, has been heeded. we’ve learned again.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_1_2_middle_4.wav|that democracy is precious. democracy is fragile.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_1_2_middle_5.wav|at this hour my friends, democracy has prevailed1.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_2_1_middle.wav|violence sought to shake this capitol’s very foundation, we come together as one nation.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_2_1_middle_2.wav|under god, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_2_1_short.wav|transfer of power.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_2_1_short_2.wav|as we have for more than two centuries.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_2_2_middle.wav|as we look ahead, in our uniquely american way, restless, bold.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_2_2_middle_2.wav|optimistic, and set our sights, on the nation we know we can be.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_2_2_middle_3.wav|and we must be. i thank my predecessors of both parties, for their presence today.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_2_2_short.wav|i thank them from the bottom of my heart.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_1_middle.wav|each of these patriots, have taken, the oath first sworn, by george washington.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_1_middle_2.wav|but the american story, depends not on any one of us, not on some of us.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_1_middle_3.wav|but on all of us. on we the people, who seek a more perfect union.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_1_short.wav|this is a great nation.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_1_short_2.wav|we are a good people.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_2_middle.wav|and over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we've come so far.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_2_middle_2.wav|but we still have far to go. we'll press forward.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_2_middle_3.wav|with speed and urgency for we have much to do, in this winter of peril.
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_2_middle_4.wav|and significant possibility. much to repair! much to restore!
biden/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_3_middle.wav|much to heal! much to build! and much to gain. few people in our nation’s history, have been more challenged.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_17_long_1.wav|for you and i that america thrives, when we give our hearts we may turn our hands to common purpose.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_17_long_2.wav|and right now, my friends, we're doing just that. and i've to say, as your president, i'm grateful to you. last summer i was in philadelphia, i met a small business owner, a woman.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_18_long.wav|i asked her, i said what do you need most. never forget what she said to me. she said looking me in my eyes she said i just want the truth. the truth. just tell me the truth.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_18_middle.wav|think of that. my fellow americans, you're owed nothing less than the truth.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_19_long.wav|and for all of you asking, when things will get back to normal, here is the truth. the only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_19_middle.wav|is to beat the virus. you've been hearing me say that for while i was running and the last fifty days i've been president.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_20_long.wav|but this is one of the most complex operations we've under and ever undertaken as a nation in a long time. that's why i'm using every power i have as president of the united states
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_20_middle.wav|to put us on a war footing to get the job done. it sounds like hyperbole but i mean it a war footing.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_24_long.wav|and now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, johnson and johnson is working together with the competitor, merck, to speed up and increase the capacity
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_24_short.wav|to manufacture new johnson and johnson vaccine, which was one shot.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_25_long.wav|in fact just yesterday i announced and i met with the ceos of both companies, i announced our plan to buy an additional one hundred million doses of johnson and johnson vaccines.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_25_middle.wav|these two companies, competitors, have come together for the good of the nation and they should be applauded for it.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_26_long.wav|it's truly a national effort, just like we saw during world war two. now because all the work we've done, we'll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in america by the end of may.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_26_middle.wav|that's months ahead of schedule. and we're mobilizing thousand of vaccinators to put the vacine in one's arm.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_27_long.wav|calling on active duty military, fema, retired doctors and nurses, administrators and those to administer the shots. and we've been creating more places to get the shots.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_27_middle.wav|we've made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one, any one of ten thousand pharmacies across the country.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_28_long.wav|just like you get your flu shot. we're also working with governors and mayors in red states and blue states to set up and support nearly six hundred federally supported vaccination centers
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_28_short.wav|that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_29_long.wav|you can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car and drive home in less than an hour. we've been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_29_short.wav|all across america, located and underserved areas.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_2_long.wav|the last vacation. the last birthday with frends. the last holiday with extended family. while it was different for everyone, we all lost something. a collective suffering.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_2_middle.wav|a collective sacrifice. a year filled with the loss of life the loss of living for all of us.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_32_long.wav|when i took office fifty days ago, only eight percent of americans after months, only eight percent of those over the age of sixty five had gotten their first vaccination.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_32_short.wav|today that number's sixty five percent.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_33_long.wav|just fourteen percent of americans over the age of seventy five, fifty fifty days ago, had gotten their first shot. today that number is well over seventy percent.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_33_middle.wav|with new guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc that came out on monday. it means simply this.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_34_long.wav|millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so. and the more people are fully vacinated the cd will continue to provide additional guidance
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_34_middle.wav|on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with your friends as well as travel.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_35_long.wav|when i came in office, you may recall, i said a goal that many you said was that kind of way over the top. i said i intended to get a hundred million shots in people's arms in my first hundred days in office.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_35_middle.wav|tonight i can say we're not only going to meet that goal, we're going to beat that goal.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_37_long.wav|first, tonight i'm announcing that i will direct all states, tribes and territories to make all adults, people eighteen and over, eligible to be vaccinated no later than may one.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_37_middle.wav|let me say that again. all adult americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than may one.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_39_long.wav|and to do this we're gonna go from a million shots a day that i promised in december, before i was sworn in, to maintaining, beating our current pace of two million shots a day
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_39_short.wav|outpacing the rest of the world.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_3_long.wav|but in the loss we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect and gratitude. finding light in the darkness is a very american thing to do.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_3_middle.wav|in fact, it may be the most american thing we do. and that's what we've done.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_40_long.wav|secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in may, we will launch, with our partners, new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_40_middle.wav|including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_41_long.wav|no more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones. thirdly, with the passage of the american rescue plan, and i thank again the house and senate for passing it
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_41_middle.wav|and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff including busdrivers.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_42_long.wav|we can accelerate massive, nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely. and meet my goal, that i stated at the same time about a hundred million shots of opening majority of k through eight schools
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_42_short.wav|in my first hundred days in office.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_43_long.wav|this is gonna be the number one priority of my new secretary of education, miguel cardona. fourth, in the coming weeks we will issue further guidance
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_43_middle.wav|on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated, to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe and encourage more people to get vaccinated.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_44_long.wav|and finally fifth, and maybe most importantly, i promise i will do everything in my power, i will not relent until we beat this virus. but i need you
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_44_middle.wav|the american people. i need you. i need every american to do their part. that's not hyperbole. i need you.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_46_long.wav|because here's the point, if we do all this, if we do our part, we do this together by july the fourth there's a good chance you, your families and friends
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_46_middle.wav|will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighbourhood and have a cookout and a barberque and celebrate independence day.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_48_long.wav|where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus. but to get there we can't let our guard down.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_48_middle.wav|this fight is far from order, from over. as i told the woman in pennsylvania, i'll tell you the truth.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_49_long.wav|a july fourth with your loved once is the goal. but a goal a lot can happen. conditions can change. the scientists have made clear, that things may get worse again
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_49_short.wav|as new variants of the virus spread.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_4_long_1.wav|we've seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives, sometimes losing them, to save and help others. researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_4_long_2.wav|and so many of you, as hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places. i know it's been hard. i truly know.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_50_long.wav|we've got work to do to ensure that everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines. so my message to you is this. listen to doctor fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_50_short.wav|he's assured us the vaccines are safe.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_51_long.wav|they underwent rigorous scientific review. i know they're safe. vice president harronis harris and i know they're safe. that's why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_51_middle.wav|so for the world to see, so you could see us do it. the first lady and the second gentleman also got vaccinated.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_52_long.wav|talk to your family, friends, your neighbors, the people you know best who've gotten the vaccine. we need everyone to get vaccinated. we need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distance
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_52_short.wav|and keep wearing the mask as recommended by the cdc.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_53_long.wav|cause even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity. and national unity isn't just how politics and politicians vote in washington
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_53_middle.wav|or what the loudest voices say on cable or online. unity is what we do together as fellow americans.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_54_long.wav|because if we don't stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. please, we don't want to do that again. we've made so much progress.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_54_short.wav|this is not the time to let up.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_55_long.wav|just as we're emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules. i'll close with this.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_55_middle.wav|we've lost so much over the last year. we've lost family and friends. we've lost businesses and dreams we spent years building.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_56_long.wav|we've lost time, time with each other. and our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools. no graduation ceremonies this this spring, no graduations from college, high school
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_56_short.wav|moving up ceremonies. you know, there's something else we lost.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_57_long.wav|we lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the american people. but as i stand here tonight, we're proving once again something i've said
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_57_short.wav|time and time again and they're probably tired to hear me say it.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_58_long.wav|i said it foreign leaders ard domestic alike. it's never, ever a good bet to bet against the american people. america is coming back.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_58_middle.wav|the development, manufacture and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_59_long.wav|it's one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished. we also just saw the perseverance rover land on mars. stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_59_middle.wav|another example of the extraordinary american ingenuity, commitment and belief in science and one another.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_5_long_1.wav|i've told you before, i carry a card in my pocket with the number of americans who have died from covid to date. it's on the back of my schedule.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_5_long_2.wav|as of now, total deaths in america five hundred and twenty seven thousand seven hundred and twenty six.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_60_long.wav|and today i signed into law the american rescue plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions people
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_60_short.wav|includes one thousand four hundred dollars in direct rescue checks, payments.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_64_long.wav|in the coming weeks and months i'll be traveling along with the first lady, the vice president, the second gentleman, members of my cabinet to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the american rescue plan meets the moment.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_64_short.wav|and if it fails at any pay i will acknowledge that it failed.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_65_long.wav|but it will not. about how after long dark years one whole year, there is hope and light of better days ahead. if we all do our part
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_65_middle.wav|this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_66_long_1.wav|we will have proven once again, that this country can do anything. hard thigs, big things, important things. over a year ago
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_66_long_2.wav|no one could've imagined what we were about to go through. but now we're coming through it. and it's a shared experience binds us together as a nation.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_67_long_1.wav|we are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. we're also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_67_long_2.wav|my fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we've been through we'll come together as one people, one nation, one america.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_68_long.wav|i believe we can and we will. we're seizing this moment. and history, i believe, will record, we faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation's history.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_68_short.wav|darkest we've ever known.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_6_long_1.wav|that's more deaths than in world war one, world war two, the vietnam war and nine eleven combined. there were husbands, wives, sons and daughters.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_6_long_2.wav|grandparents, friends, neighbors, young and old. they leave behind love ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even to have a funeral.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_70_long.wav|and there's nothing, nothing, from the bottom of my heart i believe, that there's nothing we can't do when we do it together. so god bless you all.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_70_middle.wav|and please, god, give solace to all those people who lost someone. and may god protect our troops.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_7_long.wav|but i'm also thinking about everyone else, who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident or other diseases. they too died alone.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_7_short.wav|they too leave behind loved ones who hurt him badly.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_8_long.wav|you know, you've often heard me say before, i talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his child's bedroom to say i'm sorry, i lost my job.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_8_middle.wav|can't be here anymore. like my dad told me when he lost his job in scranton.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_9_long.wav|so many of you've had to make that same walk this past year. you lost your job. you closed your business. facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control.
biden/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_9_short.wav|it may be worst of all a loss of hope.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_1_1_long.wav|good afternoon. before I begin today's announcement, let me take a few moments to thank, all the law enforcement folks for, all they did the military personnel.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_10_long.wav|businesses are closed for good. schools are caught in between. and while the vaccine provides so much hope, the rollout has been a dismal failure thus far.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_10_short.wav|so, i understand the despair and frustration of so many americans.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_11_long.wav|i understand why many governors, mayors, country officials, tribal leaders feel like they're left on their own without a clear national plan to get them through the crisis. let me be very clear.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_11_short.wav|things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_12_long.wav|the memorial we we held two nights ago, will not be our last one, unfortunately. the death toll will likely top five hundred thousand next month. the cases will continue to mount.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_12_short.wav|we didn't get into this mess overnight. that's going to take months for us to turn things around.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_13_middle.wav|but let me be equally clear, we will get through this. we will defeat this pandemic.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_13_short.wav|and to a nation waiting for action let me be the clearest on this point.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_14_middle.wav|this plan reflects ah the ideas i set forward during the campaign, and ah further refined over the past three months.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_15_middle.wav|our national strategy is comprehensive. it's based on science, not politics. it's based on truth, not denial. and it's detailed.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_15_short.wav|you can review this entire plan, this entire plan.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_16_short.wav|and and and and pro complete detail, what we're going to do.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_18_middle.wav|and i explained, as i explained last week, we will move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated for free.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_18_short.wav|and create more places for them to get vaccinated.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_19_middle.wav|yesterday, we got started. we directed the federal eh emergency management agency, fema.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_19_short.wav|to start standing up the first federally supported community vaccination centers.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_1_middle.wav|the president, as president as Commander In Chief, I always respect and Revere their service, and that of their families. but now to today's announcement.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_20_middle.wav|the centers for disease control and prevention will launch the federal fharmacy program to make vaccines available to communities.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_22_middle.wav|and to ensure we have enough vaccinators, the people doing the vaccines, to meet the nation's needs and quickly.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_22_short.wav|in addition to this effort.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_23_middle.wav|we allo, are going to take immediate steps to partner with governors, mayors, and other local officials, who we've been talking to all along, who are on the front lines of this fight.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_25_middle.wav|this is a model, we use to respond to hurricane hurricane sandy, which i was deeply invowed with.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_25_short.wav|and in just a few moments, i'm going to sign a declaration.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_26_middle.wav|something democrats and republicans governors alike have called for. but the brutal truth is.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_26_short.wav|it's going to take months before we can get the majority of americans vaccinated.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_27_middle.wav|one of our one hundred day challenges is asking the american people to mask up.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_27_short.wav|for the first hundred days, the next ninety nine days.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_29_middle.wav|and if we do this as americans, the experts say by wearing a mask from now until april.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_29_short.wav|we'd save more than fifty thousand lives going forward.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_2_middle.wav|Xavier Bessara, excuse me, our nominee for secretary of health and human services. doctor Vivek Murthy, our nominee for surgeon general.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_30_middle.wav|yesterday, i signed an executive action, that requires mask and social distancing on federal property.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_30_short.wav|today we'll be signing an additional exce executive action.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_34_middle.wav|well, as i said, last night, four hundred thousand americans have died.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_34_short.wav|that's more than have died in all of world war two.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_35_middle.wav|today, i am signing an executive action to use the defense production act, and all other available authorities to direct all federal agencies.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_35_short.wav|and private industry.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_37_middle.wav|today, we're directing the department of education and the department of health and human services to immediately provide schools and communities with clear guidance.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_37_short.wav|and resources, to safely reopen the schools.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_39_middle.wav|we're going to put the full force of the federal government, behind expanding testing by launching a covid nineteen pandemic testing board.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_39_short.wav|this effort will ensure that we get testing to where it is needed.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_3_long.wav|and ah doctor Marcella Nunez-Smith, who will be leading our equity work and the covid response. and Jeff Zients and Natalie Quillian, who are managing this whole effort.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_3_short.wav|yesterday, yesterday, during my inaugual address.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_40_middle.wav|and protecting the most vulnerable like those who live in long-term long-term care facilities. and for the millions of workers.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_41_middle.wav|i'm calling for the enforcement of a more stringent worker safety standards so that you are better protected from this virus.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_42_middle.wav|today, i am formalizing the health equitty task forse, that we announced in the transition.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_44_middle.wav|we will make sure that science and public exp scientists and public ef experts will speak directly to you. that's why you're going to hear a lot more from doctor fauci again.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_46_middle.wav|the Vice President Harris and i, and our entire administration will always be honest and transparent with you about both the good news, and the bad.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_48_middle.wav|progress of our plan will take time to measure as people getting infected today, they don't show up as case counts for weeks.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_49_middle.wav|but i also but also know, we can do this if we come together.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_50_middle.wav|healthcare providers and business, and civic, and religious, and civil rights organizations, and unions.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_52_middle.wav|it requires congress coming together to provide the necessary funding, in the covid relief package and the american rescue plan that i will soon be sending to the congress.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_54_middle.wav|as i said yesterday in my inaugural address, there are moments in history, when more is asked of a particular generation, more asked of us as americans than other times.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_55_middle.wav|the american people have given so much already, but i believe they're ready to set big goals.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_56_middle.wav|i'm convinced, the american people are already as well to spare no effort, no expense to get this done.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_57_middle.wav|and get back to our lives and to our loved ones. we can do this. we can do this if we stand together.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_5_middle.wav|on tuesday, Jill and i, Kamala and Doug, we stood at the reflecting pool, in front of the Lincoln Memorial.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_6_long.wav|and i said at that moment, that, to heal, we must remember. to heal, we must remember. it's important to do that as a nation. when we must also act though, not just remember.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_6_short.wav|yet for the past a year.
biden/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_8_middle.wav|to put that in context, america makes up four percent of the world's population, but twenty five percent of the world's confirmed coved nineteen cases.

biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_12_middle.wav|you have a historic opportunity be remembered as the rada that finally and permanently laid in place the pillars of freedom.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_13_middle.wav|the president, the prime minister, the members of this august body, all of you must put aside parochial differences.

biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_20_long_2.wav|in the end, it came down to extraordinary patriots, individuals putting their, personal needs behind the needs of their nation, their narrow interest.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_20_short.wav|behind, unity.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_21_long_1.wav|ladies and gentlemen, i believe the president, the prime minister, every member of this body, now faces a similar test of courage.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_21_long_2.wav|to quote an early american patriot, Thomas Paine, these are the times that try men's souls. these are the times.

biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_23_long_1.wav|each of you has an obligation, to answer the call of history, and finally build a united, democratic ukranian nation.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_23_long_2.wav|that can stand the test of time. Edmund Burke, said it best in seventeen seventy four, speaking to his constituency, in bristol, england.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_24_long.wav|here's what he said, parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole.

biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_28_short.wav|a place which i visited yesterday.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_29_long.wav|all one has to do is look at the photographs of the heavenly hundred, at the spontaneously erected monument where i stood yesterday. just look at the photographs.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_29_short.wav|this is not hyperbole. i am not trynna be unduly this is real.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_29_short_2.wav|as a foreigner, all i have to do is look at the photographs.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_2_long.wav|ladies and gentlemen, i am deeply honoured, to be invited to speak to you today, at a moment marked by great opportunity, as well as great uncertainty.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_2_short.wav|for the people of Ukraine.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_30_long_1.wav|see the photographs of young men as early as their early twentis, to those in the early eighties. every one of them were joined in common purpose, a revolution of dignity.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_30_long_2.wav|my father had an expression he repeated a thousand times growing up, every man and woman is entitled to be treated with dignity.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_31_long_1.wav|everyone. that's what your new revolution was aboud, dignity. and those martyrs still give voice to the timeless.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_31_long_2.wav|ideals in the timeless ideas, the universal values, the unite free people all around the world. i visited every part of this world.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_32_long.wav|there's fewer there's fewer than a handful of country i've not been in. i've traveled over a million thirty thousand miles just since being vice president. the whole world is watching you.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_32_short.wav|that's a fact.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_33_long.wav|they're watching you, because their hopes for your success, as you fight both the unrelenting aggression of the kremlin.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_33_short.wav|and the cancer of corruption will impact on them.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_35_long.wav|you have the united support of europe western, central, and eastern europe all invested in your democratic success because your success goes to the heart.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_35_short.wav|of an enduring commitment to a europe whole, free, and at peace.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_35_short_2.wav|if you fail, the experiment fails.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_37_long.wav|it's equally important, by the way, for aggressors around the world to understand that they can't use coercion, bribery, sending tanks and men across a border to a ext extinguish the dreams and hopes of a people.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_37_short.wav|for if you succeed, that message is sent around the world.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_3_long.wav|the stakes, the stakes for your country and the expectations of your people, have never been higher, because Ukraine, as you know better than i.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_3_short.wav|has been here before.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_4_long_1.wav|in the west, as here we remember, the orange revolution - young men and women who filled the maidan a decade ago, demanding that their voices.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_4_long_2.wav|and their votes, both, be respected. they refused to back down, in the face of rigged elections, and they succeeded.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_5_long_1.wav|but as history tells us and shows us, and as we know, Ukraine's leaders proved incapable of delivering on the promise of democratic revolution.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_5_long_2.wav|we saw, reforms put in place, only, to be rolled back. we saw oligarchs uninterested in change ousted from power, only to return.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_6_long.wav|reformers, persecuted, thrown in prison as political retribution. and the bright flame of hope for a new Ukraine, snuffed out.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_6_short.wav|by the pervasive poison, of cronyism, corruption and kleptocracy.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_7_long.wav|nearly a decade later, that flame of hope was reignited, by thousands of brave ukrainians, some of you in this room, storming the maidan, demanding.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_7_short.wav|a revolution of dignity.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_7_short_2.wav|the world, was transfixed.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_8_long_1.wav|this time, they were not going to be denied the future, that so many of your country have longed for, for so long. and the world was horrified.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_8_long_2.wav|when peaceful patriots were met by violence. they stayed in the maidan day and night, facing down the berkut in riot gear.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_9_long_1.wav|for the first time since the middle ages, the bells of Saint Mary raised the alarm, calling the citizens of ukraine to reinforce their brothers and sisters, on the maidan.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_1_9_long_2.wav|tens of thousands heeded the call bringing with them food, clothing, blankets, medical supplies, and their support.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_2_1_long.wav|the president asked me back in the late winter two thousand and nine, to come to europe to speak at the munich conference to lay out.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_2_1_short.wav|the principles that would guide our administration.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_2_1_short_2.wav|the fundamental elements of american foreign policy under the obama biden administration.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_2_2_long.wav|and what i said then i will repeat now. i said, we will not recognize any nation having a sphere of influence.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_2_2_short.wav|sovereign states have the right to make their own decisions.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_2_2_short_2.wav|and choose their own alliances. period. period.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_3_1_long.wav|in the twenty first century, nations cannot and we cannot allow them, to redraw borders by force. these are the ground rules. and if we fail to uphold them.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_3_1_short.wav|we will rue the day.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_3_1_short_2.wav|we will rue the day. russia has violated these ground rules, and continues to violate them.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_1_long.wav|so the united states will continue to stand with ukraine against russian aggression. we're providing support to help and train and assist your security forces, and we've relied on and rallied.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_1_short.wav|the rest of the world to ukraine's cause.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_2_long.wav|i have spent hours as the president has, talking to heads of state in europe and around the world, making it clear, that one of the tests.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_2_short.wav|for whether or not, they are our allies.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_2_short_2.wav|is are they allied, with your purpose.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_3_long.wav|america, and europe now stand together, united in our commitment to impose tough economic sanctions on russia. and while russian aggression persists.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_3_short.wav|the cost imposed on moscow will continue to rise.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_4_middle.wav|the false propaganda, that the kremlin is disseminating in an attempt to undermine ukraine and fracture europe's resolve will not work.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_4_middle_2.wav|no one should mistake saber rattling, and bombast for strength. let me say that again, no one should mistake.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_4_short.wav|saber rattling and bombast for real strength.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_5_middle.wav|we're taking steps to bolster europe's, resilience to russian coercive tactics. we are strengthening nato as i speak, improving energy security as i speak.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_5_middle_2.wav|and attempting to help spur an economic revival, throughout europe.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_10_long_1.wav|that's not a future i believe any ukrainian wants for their children. that's why the minsk agreement needs to be implemented in full. and truly free and fair elections.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_10_long_2.wav|are exactly what the kremlin fears the most. it's not just your territory that covet, it's your success that they fear.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_11_long.wav|for if free elections occur, and the people determine, as i'm confident they will, that they want to remain and integral part.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_11_short.wav|of ukraine, that they are ukrainians first.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_11_short_2.wav|that's what russia fears. that's what putin fears.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_12_long.wav|because all of you know the struggle for ukraine's freedom is not confined to the battlefields of the east. constitutional reform that includes judicial reform and decentralization does not compromise your sovereignty. it enhances it.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_12_short.wav|it's an important step to building a strong, new nation.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_1_long.wav|and i might add parenthetically, i don't think the russian people fully understand what Putin is doing. that's why he spends so much time hiding at home, the presence of russian forces.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_1_short.wav|here in your country.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_2_long.wav|heavy weapons must be withdrawn from the frontlines. the osce must be granted full, unencumbered access. russia, must press the separtists.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_2_short.wav|to hold elections according to ukrianian law.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_2_short_2.wav|and osce standards.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_2_short_3.wav|and disavow the illegal election that's just taken place.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_4_long.wav|unless all, ukraine has if they do all of that, and only if they do, ukraine also has responsibility it still has to fulfill, including amnesty for those who have not committed capital offences.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_4_short.wav|granting devolved administration to the donbas.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_5_long.wav|but we've made it clear to russia and the world, that continued delay and foot-dragging is unacceptable. that includes elections in the donbas. they can only go forward, as stipulated under the minsk agreement.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_5_short.wav|full access to the media must be provided.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_5_short_2.wav|ukrainian political parties allowed to compete openly.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_6_long.wav|full and unobstructed osce election monitoring. full voting rights for the people displaced from their homes in the donbas and living elsewhere in ukraine. and all weapons.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_6_short.wav|contained and kept under osce osce supervision.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_7_long.wav|that only happens if russia lives up to its commitments, if russia does its part. if it does, then you must follow through with yours.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_7_short.wav|because this is the best chance to keep donbas in ukraine, end the conflict.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_7_short_2.wav|and begin restoring ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_8_long.wav|it's hard. there's nothing easy about what you have to do. there's nothing easy. the pressure you will all get will be immense. i'd like to also speak.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_8_short.wav|directly, to the people in the donbas.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_9_long.wav|the alternative to what i just said is to continue to live under seperatists thugs, criminals who deny humanitarian aid, keep out organizations like doctors without borders, stealing lifesaving medicine to sell on the black market.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_9_short.wav|that's not a future.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_10_middle.wav|russia is trynna undermine the stability and sovereignty of ukraine any way they can't, including squeezing ukraine financially, trynna undermine your economy.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_10_short.wav|they view that as a cheaper way than sending tanks across the line of contact.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_10_short_1.wav|it's in the national security interest of the nation.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_11_middle_1.wav|so ukraine must be strong enough to choose its own future, strongly. strong defensively.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_11_middle_2.wav|strong economically. a strong system of democratic governance. the united states is with you in this fight.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_11_short.wav|we understand we're with you afar. it's much harder for you than it is for us.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_12_middle.wav|we've stepped up with official assistance to help backstop the ukrainian economy. we've rallied the international community to commit a total of twenty five billion dollars in bilateral and multilateral financing.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_12_middle_2.wav|to support ukraine. it includes two billion dollars in us loan guarantees and the possibility of more.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_15_middle.wav|but for ukraine to continue to make progress and to keep the support of the international community you have to do more, as well. the big part of moving forward with your imf program.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_15_short.wav|it requires difficult reforms. and they are difficult. let me say parenthetically here.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_16_middle.wav|all the experts you know from our state department and all the think tanks, and they come and tell you, that you know what you should do is you should deal with pensions.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_16_middle_2.wav|you should deal with as if it's easy to do. hell, we're having trouble in america dealing with it. we're having trouble.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_17_middle.wav|to vote to raise the pension age, is to write your political obituary in many places.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_17_middle_2.wav|don't misunderstand that those of us who serve in other democratic insitutions don't understand how hard the conditions are, how difficult it is.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_17_short.wav|to cast some of the votes to meet the obligations committed to under the imf.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_18_middle.wav|it requires sacrifices that might not be politically expedient or popular. but they're critical to putting ukraine on the path to a future.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_18_middle_2.wav|that is economically secure. and i urge you to stay the course as hard as it is. ukraine needs a budget that's consistent with your imf commitments.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_1_long.wav|autonomous, independent states, their determination to have their own police forces, their determination to have their own education system, to have their own government under, the united constitution.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_1_short.wav|but in addition, you also have a battle, a historic battle.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_1_short_2.wav|against corruption.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_20_middle.wav|the ukrainian people've long struggled to direct their own destinies, to carve out a place, besides the mighty dnipro.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_20_short.wav|to claim their own identity, proud and distinct.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_21_middle.wav|a great poet taras shevcnenko, wrote verse after verse declaiming the spirit of ukraine.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_21_middle_2.wav|urging his fellow ukrainians to rise up and claim their liberty. his poem the testament ends with this reflection.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_3_long.wav|and if the people resign themselves to explotation and corruption, for fear of losing whatever little they have left, that would be the death knell, for ukrainian democracy.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_4_long_1.wav|not enough has been done yet. as the prime minister and the president heard me often say, i never tell another man or another nation or another woman what's in their interest.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_4_long_2.wav|but i can tell you, you cannot name me a single democracy in the world, where the cancer of corruption, is prevalent.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_7_long.wav|it's not enough to push through law to increase transparency with regard to official sources of income. senior elected officials have to remove all conflicts between their business interest and their governent responsibilities.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_9_long.wav|corruption siphons away resources from the people. it blunts the economic growth, and it affronts the human dignity. we know that. you know that. the ukrainian people know that.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_8_1_middle.wav|i will speak for of ukraine. i will speak of the writer who took a beating on the maidan to put him in the hospital. when asked, why he.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_8_1_middle_2.wav|he sustained those injuries, why he was willing to endure it, he wrote people who don't protest injustice, they have no future.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_10_middle.wav|and for the first and only time in my career, i was seized with, my god, one of the great men in our history stoo d in this spot. and i wondered, what it'd have been like.

biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_10_short.wav|well, that's where you are.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_11_middle.wav|it's not hyperbole. that's where each of you sit. if you succeed, you will be.

biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_1_middle.wav|now people don't think about what ukraine can give them but about what they can give to ukraine. i will speak of the men and women of this institution.

biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_4_middle.wav|please for the sake of the rest of us, selfishly on my part, don't waste it. seize the opportunity.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_4_middle_2.wav|build a better future, for the people of ukraine. there was a famous american politician when i was a young senator.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_5_middle.wav|he was in the other party, very different ideology. but he said, once in response to a question, he said, in your heart.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_5_middle_2.wav|in your heart, you know it's right. in your heart, you know what's right. you know. do it.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_6_middle.wav|as long as you remain on that path, as long as you honor the obligation to the ukrainian people, you never have to worry or doubt america and the united states.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_6_middle_2.wav|i hesitated to come to make this speech. the reason i did is not because my a lack of affection for your country.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_6_short.wav|will be by your side.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_7_middle.wav|but as a man who sat where you're sitting for thirty six years as a united states senator.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_7_middle_2.wav|sometimes when a foreign leader would come to speak, i resented when he or she appeared to lecture us. i hope i don't come across as hectoring or lecturing you.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_7_short.wav|because that's not my intention.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_8_middle.wav|i just have, as a fellow human being, i just have such, hope.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_8_middle_2.wav|in the promise of what you could deliver. it will spread far beyond the borders of ukraine.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_9_middle.wav|i used to wonder as a young senator, when i first stood up on the senate floor, and i've never been.
biden/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_9_middle_2.wav|frightened of standing and speaking, i stood up and all of a sudden i realized, that my desk is exactly where a senator named daniel webster, spoke from. i mean this sincerely.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_10_middle.wav|And now history has delivered us, to one of the most difficult moments, America has ever faced. Four historic crises.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_10_middle_2.wav|All at the same time. A perfect storm. The worst pandemic in over hundred years. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_11_middle.wav|The most compelling call for racial justice since the sixties. And the undeniable realities and, acc, a a just accelerating threats.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_11_middle_2.wav|of climate change. So, the question for us is simple. Are we ready? I believe we are. We must be.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_12_middle.wav|We know in our bones this one is more consequential. As many i've said America is at an inflection point.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_12_middle_2.wav|A time of real peril, but of extraordinary possibilities. We can choose the path of becoming angrier.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_13_middle.wav|Or, or we can choose a different path and together, take this chance, to heal, to be reform, to unite. A path of hope and light.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_13_middle_2.wav|This is a life changing election, this will determines when America is gonna look like for a long long time. Character is on the ballot.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_14_middle.wav|Decency, science democracy. They are all on the ballot. Who you are as a nation.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_14_middle_2.wav|Decency, science democracy. They are all on the ballot.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_14_middle_3.wav|And the choice could not be clearer. No rhetoric is needed. Just judge this president on the facts.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_15_middle.wav|Five million Americans infected with covid nineteen. More than one hundred and seventy thousand Americans is died.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_15_middle_2.wav|By far the worst performance of any nation on Earth. More than fifty million people have filed for unemployment this year.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_1_middle.wav|Good evening. Ella Baker, a giant of the civil rights movement, left us with this wisdom. Give people light.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_1_middle_2.wav|and they will find a way. give people light. those are words for our time.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_1_middle_3.wav|The current president has cloaked, America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division!
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_2_middle.wav|Here and now, i give you my word. If you entrust me with the presidency, i will draw on the best of us not the worst.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_2_middle_2.wav|I'll be an ally of the light, not of the darkness. It’s time for us, for we the people, to come together.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_36_long.wav|And when we do we’ll not only build it back we’ll build it back better. With modern roads bridges highways, broadband, ports and airports, as a new foundation for economic growth.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_36_short.wav|With pipes that transport clean water, to every community.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_37_long.wav|With five million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in America. With a healthcare system that lowers premiums, deductibles, drug prices
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_37_short.wav|by building on the affordable care act he’s trynna rip away.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_38_long.wav|With an education system that trains our people for the best jobs of the twenty first century, that's the single thing, americans workers can do. And where cost doesn’t prevent, young people from going to college
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_38_short.wav|and student debt doesn’t crush them, when they get out.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_39_long.wav|With child care and elder care system. That make it possible for parents to go to work, and for the elderly to stay in their homes with dignity. With an immigration system
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_39_middle.wav|that powers our economy and reflects our values. With newly empowered labor unions. There is ones to build a middle class.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_3_middle.wav|This season of darkness in America. We will choose hope over fear, facts over fiction, fairness over privilege.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_3_middle_2.wav|I'm a proud democrat, and i will be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election. So it is with great honor, and humility.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_40_long.wav|With equal pay for women. With rising wages, you can raise a childe on, a family on. And yes, we’re gonna do more, than praise our essential workers. We’re finally gonna pay them, pay them.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_40_middle.wav|We can and we will deal with climate change. It’s not only a crisis, it’s an enormous opportunity.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_41_long.wav|An opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy, and create millions of new good paying jobs, in the process. And we can pay for these investments
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_41_middle.wav|by ending loopholes, unnecessary loopholes. And the president’s one point three trillion dollars tax giveaway to the wealthiest one percent.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_42_long.wav|And the biggest most profitable corporations some of which, do not pay any tax at all. Because we don’t need a tax code, that rewards wealth more than it rewards work.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_42_middle.wav|I’m not looking to punish anyone. Far from it. But it’s long past time the wealthiest people.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_43_long.wav|And the biggest corporations in this country, paid their fair share. For our seniors, social security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made. They paid for.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_43_short.wav|The current president is threatening to break that promise.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_44_long.wav|He’s proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half of social security, without any way of making up for that lost revenue, results of cuts.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_44_long_2.wav|I will not let it happen. If i’m your president, we’re gonna protect social security and medicare. You have my word. One of the most powerful voices.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_45_long.wav|We hear in the country today, is from our young people. They’re speaking to the inequity and injustice that has grown up in America. Economic injustice. Racial injustice. Environmental injustice.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_45_short.wav|I hear their voices and if you listen you can hear them too.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_46_long.wav|And whether it’s the exisdential existential threat posed by climate change, the daily fear of being gunned down in school, or the inability to get started in their first job.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_46_middle.wav|It will be the work of the next president to restore the promise, of America to everyone. I'm luckn’t have to do it alone.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_47_long.wav|Because i'll have a great vice president at my side. Senator Kamala Harris. She is a powerful voice for this nation. Her story is the American story.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_47_long_2.wav|She knows about all the obstacles thrown in the way of so many in our country. Women, black women, black americans, South Asian Americans immigrants.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_48_long.wav|The left out and left behind. But she’s overcome every obstacle she’s ever faced. No one’s been tougher on the big banks or the gun or the gun lobby.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_48_middle.wav|No one’s been tougher in calling out this current administration for its extremism, its failure to follow the law.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_49_long.wav|And its failure to simply tell the truth. Kamala and I, that's we get our strength.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_49_long_2.wav|For Kamala's doug and their families. For me, it’s Jill and ours. I've said many times no man deserves one great love in his life leave alone two. But I’ve known two. After losing my first wife in a car accident.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_4_long.wav|Of the United States of America. But while i'll be a democratic candidate, i'll be an American president. I’ll work hard for those who didn’t support me, as hard for them as i did for those who did vote for me.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_4_middle.wav|That’s the job of a president. To represent all of us, not just our base or our party.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_50_long.wav|Jill came into my life, and put our family back together. She’s an educator. A mom, a military mom. And an unstoppable force.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_50_long_2.wav|If she puts her mind to it, just get out of the way. She’s gonna get it done. She was a great second lady and, i know she will make a great first lady for this nation.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_51_long.wav|And i always have the strength, that can only come from family. Hunter, Ashley, all our grandchildren, my brothers my sister.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_51_long_2.wav|They give me courage, they lift me up. While he is no longer with us, Beau inspires me every day. Beau served our nation in uniform.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_52_long.wav|You know Iraq a decorated, Iraq a war veteran. So i take very personally, and i the profound responsibility, of serving as commander in chief.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_52_middle.wav|I'll be a president who stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries, the days of cozying up to dictators is over.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_53_long.wav|Under president Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties, on the heads of American soldiers. Nor'll i put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise, voting.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_53_middle.wav|And i'll always stand, for human rights and dignity. I'll work in common purpose.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_54_long.wav|For a more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world. History, history has thrust, one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_54_long_2.wav|that finally wipes out the stain of racism, from our national character? I believe we’re up to it. I believe we’re ready. Just a week ago yesterday.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_55_long.wav|Was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville. Close your eyes, remember to sound television remember seeing those neo nazis and klansmen and white supremacists, coming out of the fields with lighted torches?
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_55_short.wav|Veins bulging? Spewing, the same, same antisemitic bile.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_56_long.wav|Heard across Europe in the thirties? Remember the violent clash that ensued, between those spreading hate, and those with the courage to stand against it? Remember what the president said?
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_56_middle.wav|He said there were quote, very fine people, on both sides. It was a wake up call for us as a country.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_57_long.wav|And for me, a call to action. At that moment, i knew i’d have to run. My father taught us that silence, was complicity. And i can never remain silent or complicit.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_57_long_2.wav|At the time, i said we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. And we are. You know.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_58_long.wav|One of the most important conversations i’ve had this entire campaign, is with someone with someone who is much too young to vote. I met with six year old Gianna Floyd, a day before her daddy George Floyd was laid to rest.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_58_middle.wav|She is incredibly brave long girl. I’ll never forget it when I leaned down.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_59_long.wav|To speak with her, she looked into my eyes and she said in night cot, daddy, changed the world. Daddy, changed the world. Her words burrowed deep into my heart.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_59_middle.wav|Maybe George Floyd’s murder, was the breaking point. Maybe John Lewis’ passing the inspiration.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_5_long.wav|This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment. It’s a moment that calls for hope, and light and love. Hope, for our futures, light to see our way forward, and love for one another.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_5_middle.wav|America isn’t just a collection of, clashing interests, of red states or blue states.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_60_long.wav|But are however it has come to be, however it's happened. America is ready to in John’s words, to lay down cost the heavy burdens of hate, at last
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_60_long_2.wav|and to do the hard work, of rooting out, our systemic racism. You know, America’s history tells us, that it been in our darkest moments.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_61_long.wav|That we’ve made our greatest progress. That we’ve found the light. And in this dark moment, i believe we are poised to make great progress again.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_61_long_2.wav|That we can find the light once more. You know, many people of heard me said this but i always believed you can define America in one word. Possibilities.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_62_long.wav|That defined in future America everything is possible. That America everyone, and I mean everyone, should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God given ability will take them.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_62_middle.wav|We can never lose that. In times as challenging as these, i believe there is only one way forward.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_63_long.wav|As a united America, are united America. United in our pursuit of a more perfect union. United, in our dreams of a better future, for us and for our children.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_63_long_2.wav|United in our determination, to make the coming years bright. Are we ready? I believe we are.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_64_long.wav|This is a great nation we are a good and decent people. For large say this is the United, States of America. And there has never been anything, we’ve been unable to accomplish, when we’ve done it together.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_64_middle.wav|The Irish poet Seamus Heaney, once wrote. History says.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_65_long.wav|Don’t hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope, and history rhyme.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_65_long_2.wav|This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme! With passion and purpose, let us begin! You and i together, one nation under God.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_66_long.wav|United in our love for America, united in our love for each other! For love is more powerful hate! Hope is more powerful than fear! And light is more powerful than dark! This is our moment! This is our mission!
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_66_short.wav|May history be able to say.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_67_long.wav|That the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight, as love and hope and light, joined in the battle, for the soul of the nation. And this is a battle we will win and we'll do it together!
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_67_middle.wav|I promise you. Thank you. And may God bless you. And may God protect our troops. Good night!
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_6_long.wav|We’re so much bigger than that. We’re so much better than that. Now nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt, pledged a new deal, in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty and fear.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_6_middle.wav|Stricken by disease, stricken by a virus, fdr insisted that he would recover and prevail.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_7_long.wav|And he believed America could as well. And he did. And we can as well. This campaign isn’t just about winning votes. It’s about winning the heart and yes the soul of America.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_7_short.wav|Winning it for the generous among us, not the selfish.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_8_long.wav|Winning it for the workers who keep this country going not just the privileged few at the top. Winning it for those communities, who have known the injustice of the knee on the neck.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_8_short.wav|For all the young people, who have known only an America been.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_9_long.wav|Of rising inequity and shrinking opportunity. They deserve, to experience, of America’s promise. They deserve to experience in full.
biden/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_9_long_2.wav|You know. No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know, is whether we’ll be ready, when that moment arrives.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_10_middle.wav|watching the generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more, because they had not been at school because of their loss of learning.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_10_middle_2.wav|it's the details of life that matter most and we've missed those details. the big details and small moments.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_11_middle.wav|weddings, birthdays, graduations, all the things that needed to happen but didn't.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_11_middle_2.wav|the first date. the family reunions. the sunday night rituals. it's all
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_11_short.wav|as exacted terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_1_long.wav|my fellow americans. tonight, i'd like to talk to you about where we are, as we mark one year since everything stopped, because of this pandemic.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_1_middle.wav|a year ago we were hit with the virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_2_long.wav|denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness. photos and videos from twenty nineteen
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_2_long_2.wav|feel like they were taken in another era. the last vacation. the last birthday with friends. the last holiday with extended family.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_3_long.wav|while it was different for everyone, we all lost something. a collective suffering. a collective sacrifice. a year filled with the loss of life
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_3_long_2.wav|the loss of living for all of us. but in the loss we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect and gratitude.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_4_long.wav|finding light in the darkness is a very american thing to do. in fact it may be the most american thing we do. and that's what we've done.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_4_long_2.wav|we've seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives sometimes losing them to save and help others. researches and scientists racing for a vaccine.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_5_long.wav|and so many of you, as hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places. i know it's been hard. i truly know.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_6_middle.wav|as of now total deaths in america five hundred and twenty seven thousand
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_6_middle_2.wav|seven hundred and twenty six. that's more deaths than in world war one, world war two
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_6_middle_3.wav|the vietnam war and nine eleven combined. there were husbands
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_6_middle_4.wav|wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbors, young and old.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_7_middle.wav|they leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heel, even to have a funeral. but i'm also thinking about everyone else
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_7_middle_2.wav|who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident or other diseases.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_7_middle_3.wav|they too died alone. they too leave behind loved once who are hurting badly.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_8_middle.wav|you know you've often heard me say before, i talk about the longest walk any parent can make
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_8_middle_2.wav|is up a short flight of stairs to his child's bedroom to say i'm sorry, but lost my job.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_8_middle_3.wav|can't be here anymore. like my dad told me when he lost his job in scranton.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_9_middle.wav|so many of you had to make that same walk this past year. you're lost your job, you closed your business.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_9_middle_2.wav|facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control, maybe worst of all a loss of hope.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_13_middle.wav|and now at the direction and with the assistance of my administration johnson and johnson
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_13_middle_2.wav|is working together with the competitor, merck, to speed up and increase the capacity
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_13_short.wav|to manufacture new johnson and johnson vaccine, which is one shot.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_14_middle.wav|in fact just yesterday I announced and I met with the ceos of both companies, I announced our plan
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_14_middle_2.wav|to buy an additional one hundred million doses of johnson and johnson vaccines.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_14_middle_3.wav|these two companies, competitors, have come together for the good of the nation and they should be applauded for it.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_15_middle.wav|it's truly a national effort, just like we saw during world war two. now because all the work we've done
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_15_middle_2.wav|we'll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in america by the end of may.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_15_middle_3.wav|that's months ahead of schedule. and we're mobilizing thousand of vaccinators to put the vacine in one's arm.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_16_middle.wav|calling on active duty military, fima, retired doctors and nurses, administrators and those to administer the shots.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_16_middle_2.wav|we've made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one, any one of ten thousand pharmacies across the country.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_16_short.wav|and we've been creating more places to get the shots.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_17_middle.wav|just like you get your flu shot. we're also working with governors and mayors, in red states and blue states
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_17_middle_2.wav|federally supported vaccination centers that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_17_short.wav|to set up in support nearly six hundred
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_18_short.wav|you can drive up to a stadium or a large parky lot
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_18_short_2.wav|get your shot, never leave your car and drive home in less than an hour.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_18_short_3.wav|we've been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_18_short_4.wav|all across America, located and underserved areas.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_1_middle.wav|grandparents haven't seen their children or grandchildren. parents haven't seen their kids. kids haven't seen their friends.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_1_middle_2.wav|the things we used to do, that always filled us with joy, have become the things we couldn't do
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_1_middle_3.wav|and broke our hearts. too often we've turned against one another.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_21_short.wav|when i took office fifty days ago
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_21_short_2.wav|only eight percent of americans after months
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_21_short_3.wav|only eight percent of those over the age of sixty five had gotten their first vaccination.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_21_short_4.wav|today that number's sixty five percent.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_22_short.wav|just fourteen percent of americans
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_22_short_2.wav|over the age of seventy five, fifty, fifty days ago, had gotten their first shot.
biden/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_22_short_3.wav|today that number is well over seventy percent.
